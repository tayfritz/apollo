<!-- Why did I choose the name 'apollo' for this project? -->
Why apollo you might ask? After all what does apollo have to do with a wedding planning website? Well the apollo program was the culmination of ingenuity, hard work, and creativity and those are the three characteristics I hope you will see in this project site. Of course there's much more to be built upon here. Similar to how from apollo we built the ISS, the Shuttle, and now we benefit from SpaceX. This site too is a launchpad. Into a greater world of wedding planning. 

<!-- What is a Buschel and A Peck? -->
The idea behind this website was to build a wedding planning website for the average bride and groom. Most wedding websites cater, predominately, to couples planning for over a year - at least - and with thousands of dollars to spend. Many couples out there just want a simple but beautiful day without breaking the bank. That's who this site would be catered towards. The long-term vision for this site is that these couples are able to 'login' to their profile where all of their wedding docs are stored. From there they receive custom money saving or time saving tips. Additionally, they can recruit a friend or family member to 'coordinate' their wedding - since professional coordinators can cost over $1000. This coordinator would be able to login to their own dashboard after being invited, and see all the current planning and tasks to do for the couple. This website is to cater to those who need a boost in the planning process so that they can have the wedding of their dreams, regardless of price or time willing or able to be spent.

<!-- What to expect and what to look for -->
This project includes all requirements to meet the Code Louisville Front-End Web Development Final Project standards. But I chose to include some more 'optional' functionality as well. Here's what to look for: 

- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (a hamburger menu)

- Flexbox added to 2 or more content areas on the page as the screen changes sizes (navigation, tips div, form, footer)

- Media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two to three column desktop layout (welcome and form, tips div)

- Form validation that checks for the validity of 4 input elements including the validity of an email input

- A JavaScript function, triggered by the user, whose return value is used on the site (hamburger menu, form validation, date picker)

- JavaScript math operations that display a countdown timer or a message to the user on the site depending on the user's input to the date selector (flatpickr).

- An image carousel with 6 images that it rotates through with user interaction
